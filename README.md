# Prompt Engineering Playbook

This repository documents a structured approach to prompt engineering,
treating prompt design as an engineering discipline rather than
trial-and-error.

It focuses on:
- Prompt structure
- Task definition
- Constraints and output control
- Evaluation and iteration strategies

The content is based on applied practice and academic training
in Prompt Engineering and Machine Learning.
