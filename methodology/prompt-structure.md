# Prompt Structure

All prompts in this repository follow a consistent structure:

1. **Role**  
   Defines the behavior and expertise of the model.

2. **Task**  
   Clearly specifies what needs to be done.

3. **Constraints**  
   Rules, limitations, and boundaries for the output.

4. **Output Format**  
   Defines how the response should be structured.

This structure is used to improve consistency, controllability, and evaluation of model outputs.
